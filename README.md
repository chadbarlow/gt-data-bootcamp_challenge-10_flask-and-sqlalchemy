<h1 align="left">FLASK & SQLALCHEMY<br><i>Topic: Climate Analysis</i> </h1> 

<p>This project is a climate analysis and data exploration of the Honolulu, Hawaii area using Python, SQLAlchemy, and Flask. The main objective is to help with trip planning by providing insights into the climate of the area.</p>

## Deliverables

- Climate App: A Flask API with various routes providing climate data in JSON format.
- Precipitation Analysis: Analyzes the last 12 months of precipitation data and provides a summary of statistics.
- Station Analysis: Calculates the total number of stations, most active stations, and station temperature statistics.

## Data Science Tools

- SQLAlchemy: Used for ORM queries and database connections.
- Flask: Used for creating web applications, designing APIs, and handling requests.
- Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib: Used for data visualization.

## Limitations and Further Development

- The dataset used for the analysis is limited in scope and may not provide a comprehensive view of the climate in the Honolulu area.
- The data is static and may not reflect the most recent climate changes.
- Integrate real-time climate data to provide up-to-date information.
- Expand the analysis to cover other regions or cities to help with broader trip planning.
